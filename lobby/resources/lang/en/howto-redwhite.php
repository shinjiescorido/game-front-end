The game consists of a 100-square checkerboard having 49 WHITE squares (<img src="/img/howtoplay/redwhite/white_square.png" alt="white" />), 49 RED squares (<img src="/img/howtoplay/redwhite/red_square.png" alt="red" />) and two squares bearing the NIHTAN symbol (<img src="/img/howtoplay/redwhite/nihtan_symbol.png" alt="Nihtan" />).</p>
                                    <p>The objective of the game is to win by placing a bet on a combination that the players think the three balls will land on.</p>',
